I am a postdoc at Manufacturing Futures Institute, Carnegie Mellon University. My advisors are [Christopher McComb](https://engineering.cmu.edu/directory/bios/mccomb-christopher.html) and [Sneha Prabha Narra](https://www.meche.engineering.cmu.edu/directory/bios/narra-sneha.html). I obtained my PhD degree from University of Connecticut. My PhD advisor is [Horea T. Ilies](https://me.engr.uconn.edu/blog/faculty/ilies-horea-t/). 

Research interests
------
My principal research aim revolves around augmenting the designability and replicability of metal additive manufacturing (AM) methodologies. I aim to establish comprehensive links between the manufacturing process, material structure, and resulting properties in metal AM. These connections will be employed to engineer components that challenge the boundaries of AM capabilities and to optimize the AM process for achieving outcomes that closely align with the original design intent.
